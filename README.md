# Inventory Manager Application 
## Overview
This application is a project that I've created using Java and SQL through the [Apache Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/) , a relational database management system that allows for connection between these two languages on client-side Java applications.

Additionally this application utilizes a GUI using [AWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Window_Toolkit) and [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/) which are both toolkits.
